## Project Objective:

The primary objective of this research project is to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the viability of coastal bird breeding in the western coastal regions of Sweden. 
The central focus of this study revolves around the thorough analysis of the temporal dynamics of wave activity in these coastal areas, with a particular emphasis on ascertaining its potential deleterious effects on the avian breeding process.

## Scientific Inquiries:

This investigation encompasses an intricate examination of climatic variables intricately associated with wave activity, including wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, temperature, wave speed, and wave direction. 
The overarching aim is to elucidate the predominant climatic factor driving variations in coastal conditions, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of the evolving climate dynamics.
